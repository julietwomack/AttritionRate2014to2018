# AttritionRate2014to2018

The following SQL queries were written to calculate the annual attrition rate of a fictitious company over the past 5 years of the company's available data (2014-2018). The results were then visualized in Tableau which can be viewed by [clicking here.](https://public.tableau.com/views/AttritionRate2014to2018/AnnualAttritionRateDashboard?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

**Key takeaways are:**
- The resulting line graph indicates that the company's annual attrition rate has remained consistently above 5% with the highest annual attrition rate being 10.34% in 2015 and the lowest annual attrition rate being 3.64% in 2017. 
- It is notable that since 2016 the start of period head count has been greater than the end of period head count which may required further analysis to determine why this is the case. 
- Additionally, further analysis can be done to determine the factor(s) that contributed to a lower annual attrition rate in 2017. Determining these factors can provide guidance for decreasing annual attrition rate in the future.
